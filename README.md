# ABAP SQL Beautifier Backend

# No longer necessary since version 0.1.4. The plugin also works without a backend!
 
Import this backend into your SAP system using abapGit.
If the direct import doesn't work: Download it as a ZIP and perform the import offline using abapGit. If that doesn't work either, manually copy the code of the function module Z_ADT_PRETTY_PRINTER (must be the exact same name!) into your system.
